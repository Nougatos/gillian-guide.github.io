Download the drag-and-drop archive and then simply extract the contents into your game folder. If updating - delete update and modloader folders first. But please note that I will update this archive rarely (and mods are updated often). After installation, go through additional optimisation. If the game does not start - try to install vcredist_x86.exe that's in your game folder or your PC does not support DXVK - remove d3d9.dll from the folder or try async 1.10.3.
