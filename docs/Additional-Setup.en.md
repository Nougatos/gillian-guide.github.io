# Additional Setup
Whether you're here after using the [drag-and-drop archive](drag-and-drop-archive.md) or using the [main optimisation](main-optimisation.md), we still have to perform some setup for the best experience.

## Optimal Game Settings
???+ note ""
    These options are optimal for most. If your PC is weaker - feel free to set them lower. If your PC is stronger - feel free to set them higher, but don't blame me for the issues.
=== "1.0.8.0"
    ==Video Mode/Resolution==: Your native resolution
    ==Aspect Ratio==: Auto
    ==Texture Quality==: High
    ==Reflection Resolution==: Very High (1)
    ==Water Quality==: Very High
    ==Shadow Quality==: High, but if you're not happy with their render distance, go for Very High, but it will cost you ~20 FPS.
    ==Night Shadows==: High, or if you have no problems with FPS, Very High (2).
    ==Texture Filter Quality==: Anisotropic 16x
    ==View Distance==: Ideally set between 21 and 50 (3) Console value - 21
    ==Detail Distance==: By preference - preferably no higher than 70. Console value - 10
    ==Traffic Density==: By preference, console value - 33
    ==Definition==: Off (4).
    Vertical Synchronisation - Off.

    1. If not installing FusionFix or Shader Fixes, High
    2. If not installing FusionFix or Shader Fixes, Medium
    3. Above 70 causes instability and artefacts!
    4. If you don't like depth of field and motion blur, or if you're not installing Shader Fixes - On
    ???+ note "Console Values"
        These values were set on console versions on the game and the game is most optimized towards those.
