# Additional Setup
Whether you're here after using the [drag-and-drop archive](Drag-and-Drop-Archive.md) or using the [main optimisation](Main-Optimisation.md), we still have to perform some setup for the best experience.

## Optimal Game Settings
???+ note
    These options are optimal for most. If your PC is weaker - feel free to set them lower. If your PC is stronger - feel free to set them higher, but don't blame me for the issues.
=== "1.0.8.0"
    ==Video Mode/Resolution==: Your native resolution
    <br>==Aspect Ratio==: Auto
    <br>==Texture Quality==: High</br></br>

    ==Reflection Resolution==: Very High (1){ .annotate }

    1. If not installing FusionFix or Shader Fixes, High

    ==Water Quality==: Very High

    ==Shadow Quality==: High, but if you're not happy with their render distance, go for Very High, but it will cost you ~20 FPS.

    ==Night Shadows==: High, or if you have no problems with FPS, Very High (1).
    { .annotate }
    1. If not installing FusionFix or Shader Fixes, Medium

    ==Texture Filter Quality==: Anisotropic 16x

    ==View Distance==: Ideally set between 21 and 50 (1) Console value - 21
    { .annotate }
    1. Above 70 causes instability and artefacts!

    ==Detail Distance==: By preference - preferably no higher than 70. Console value - 10

    ==Traffic Density==: By preference, console value - 33

    ==Definition==: Off (4).
    { .annotate }
    4. If you don't like depth of field and motion blur, or if you're not installing Shader Fixes - On

    ==Vertical Synchronisation==: Off.

    ???+ note "Console Values"
        These values were set on console versions on the game and the game is most optimized towards those.
