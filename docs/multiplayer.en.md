description: Experience GTA IV Multiplayer!

# Multiplayer
GTA IV had an amazing multiplayer... and it still does! ==At least for people who [downgrade](downgrading.md)==, as Rockstar Games has removed the multiplayer from the Complete Edition. If you're tired of GTA Online and want something more classic, you should definitely check out GTA IV's multiplayer!
!!! warning ""
    It's extremely recommended to have [ZolikaPatch](essential-modding/zolikapatch.md) set up for a better multiplayer experience.

    Additionally, you may want to have [ZMenuIV](../extras/trainers/#ZMenuIV) for the ability to create and participate in custom gamemodes.

    You can also use [this](https://www.gtainside.com/en/gta4/mods/160558-gta-iv-and-eflc-all-multiplayer-clothes-are-unlocked/) to unlock all multiplayer clothing for customization.

## Games for Windows - LIVE
!!! note ""
    This section also includes steps to configure GFWL for non-mulitplayer use too, if you came here from other pages. Just skip the "Joining/Creating Lobbies" part.
!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This method is only compatible with patches 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0. It's also compatible with older patches, but they'll be put into separate lobbies.
The classic multiplayer method, the one that started it all. And the one that is obnoxiously annoying to set up. Most communities stick to it at the moment.

### Usage
???+ info "Installation"
    !!! note ""
        This step is already taken care of by [ItsClockAndre's downgrader](../downgrading/#itsclockandres-downgrader) if you chose to configure the install for GFWL. Skip it if you did.


    * Make sure you don't have an outdated installation of GFWL Marketplace and LIVE. Remove them if you do.
    * Download latest [GFWL Redistributables](https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1012-microsoft-games-for-windows-live/).
    * Install :material-file-download:`gfwllivesetup.exe`, :material-file-download:`wllogin_64.msi` and :material-file-download:`xliveredist.msi`.
    !!! question "What's the Marketplace?"
        While you do get the Marketplace, don't bother opening it or trying to make it work. Marketplace is not functional, but still must be installed for GFWL itself to work.
???+ info "Signing in"
    !!! warning ""
        This is using the same account as your [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/account) or [Xbox](https://xbox.com/account) account. Create one if you don't already have one.

        [Disable 2FA completely on the account](https://account.microsoft.com/security) to be able to sign in. You can turn it back on after you're signed in and set to sign in automatically.

    * Make sure you don't have :fontawesome-solid-gears:`xlive.dll` in the folder - rename it to :fontawesome-solid-gears:`dinput8.dll` if you do.
    * Open the game.
    * Press the ++home++ key on your keyboard. You'll be met with the startup screen.
    * Press `Use Existing LIVE Profile` to get the sign in screen.
    * Uncheck the `Save my e-mail address` and `Save my e-mail address and password` checkmarks.
    * Enter your [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/account) or [Xbox](https://xbox.com/account) account credentials to sign in.  ==Check `Sign me in automatically` for convenience and to be able to turn 2FA back on.==
    * Make yourself a cup of tea or do whatever you want for the next 5-10 minutes. I'm not kidding - it might take that long to log in. ==Don't think it's stuck - it's not.==
    * See the next part for activation.
???+ tip "Activation"
    We now have several ways to activate the game.
    === "Buying another GFWL game"
        Unironically, this is the easiest way. Don't worry - you can refund the game later, so no money is wasted. I recommend `FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage`, but any other GFWL game with [Legacy (Per-Title 5x5) activation](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Games_for_Windows_-_LIVE#List_of_games_using_Games_for_Windows_-_LIVE) will do.

        <iframe style="background: transparent; background-color: transparent;" allowtransparency="true" src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/12360/943/" frameborder="0" width="646" height="190"></iframe>

        After buying the game, go to the library, select the game and right click - Manage - CD keys and copy the key somewhere. You can refund it now.
    === "Trying out random GFWL keys online"
        This one is pretty self-explanatory - just go around online and look for random GFWL keys - they have multiple uses, so you might get lucky. These two Discord servers might help you:

        [:simple-discord: Grand Theft RevIVal](https://discord.gg/Wn5eCWGcpb){ .md-button .md-button--primary } [:simple-discord: Games For Windows Live Hub](https://discord.gg/d97u73k2TV){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
    === "RevIVal's community method"
        This Discord server is also one of the servers where you can find people to play multiplayer with. The channel with the activation method is `#gfwl-keys` (for promotion and respect reasons, I won't link it here directly), but check out the server itself too, we're welcome to anyone!

        [:simple-discord: Grand Theft RevIVal](https://discord.gg/Wn5eCWGcpb){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
    After you acquired the key and activated the game(again, this might take another 5-10 minutes, so get yourself a tea or something), you're ready to play!
???+ tip "Joining/Creating Lobbies"
    Either use the in-game phone's Multiplayer - LIVE option to join or create a lobby, or add friends in the ++home++ overlay and join their lobbies instead.

    - Explanations of menu options:
        * ==Player Match== allows to join an existing lobby of a *specific* gamemode.
        * ==Custom Match== allows to find an existing lobby of *any* gamemode.
        * ==Create Match== allows to create a lobby yourself.
    
    If you're looking for people to play with, visit this Discord server:

    [:simple-discord: Grand Theft RevIVal](https://discord.gg/Wn5eCWGcpb){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
    
## Grand Theft Auto Connected
!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This method is only compatible with patches 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0.
This is not as faithful as the original multiplayer, but currently one of the best options to experience GTA IV Multiplayer without messing with GFWL.
### Usage
???+ info "Installation"
    * Go to the [GTA Connected](https://gtaconnected.com/downloads/) website.
    * Download latest client version.
    * Install the :material-file-download:`GTAC-x.x.x.exe` in :material-zip-box:`GTAC-x.x.x.zip`.
???+ tip "Configuration"
    * Set the `Game` box to `Grand Theft Auto IV`.
    * In the Tools - Launcher Settings window, set your nickname. You can also set various settings as desired.
    * In the Tools - Game Settings window, set the path to your GTA IV install. You can also set various settings as desired.
???+ tip "Joining servers"
    After you've set up the settings, it's as easy as double clicking on any server you want in the list. You'll be presented with the game's main menu - just hit Play.
???+ tip "Setting up a server"
    * Download the server from the [GTA Connected](https://gtaconnected.com/downloads/) website.
