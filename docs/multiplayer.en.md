# Multiplayer
GTA IV had an amazing multiplayer... and it still does! ==At least for people who [downgrade](downgrading.md)==, as Rockstar Games has removed the multiplayer from the Complete Edition. If you're tired of GTA Online and want something more classic, you should definitely check out GTA IV's multiplayer!

## Games for Windows - LIVE
!!! note ""
    This section also includes steps to configure GFWL for non-mulitplayer use too, if you came here from other pages. Just skip the "Joining/Creating Lobbies" part.
The classic multiplayer method, the one that started it all. And the one that is obnoxiously annoying to set up. Most communities stick to it at the moment.

### Usage
???+ info "Installation"
    !!! note ""
        This step is already taken care of by [ItsClockAndre's downgrader](../downgrading/#) if you chose to configure the install for GFWL. Skip it if you did.


    * Make sure you don't have an outdated installation of GFWL Marketplace and LIVE. Remove them if you do.
    * Download latest [GFWL Redistributable](https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1012-microsoft-games-for-windows-live/).
    * Install :material-file-download:`gfwllivesetup.exe`, :material-file-download:`wllogin_64.msi` and :material-file-download:`xliveredist.msi`.
???+ info "Signing in"
    !!! warning ""
        This is using the same account as your [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/account) or [Xbox](https://xbox.com/account) account. Create one if you don't already have one.

        [Disable 2FA completely on the account](https://account.microsoft.com/security) to be able to sign in. You can turn it back on after you're signed in and set to sign in automatically.

    * Make sure you don't have :fontawesome-solid-gears:`xlive.dll` in the folder - rename it to :fontawesome-solid-gears:`dinput8.dll` if you do.
    * Open the game.
    * Press the ++home++ key on your keyboard. You'll be met with the sign in screen.
    * Enter your [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/account) or [Xbox](https://xbox.com/account) account credentials to sign in.  ==Check `Sign me in automatically` for convenience and to be able to turn 2FA back on.==
    * Make yourself a cup of tea or do whatever you want for the next 5-10 minutes. I'm not kidding - it might take that long to log in. Don't think it's stuck - it's not.
    * See the next part for activation.
???+ tip "Activation"
    We now have several ways to activate the game.
    === "Buying another GFWL game"
        Unironically, this is the easiest way. Don't worry - you can refund the game later, so no money is wasted (except for taxes if you're American). I recommend `FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage`:

        <iframe allowtransparency="true" style="background: #1b2838;" src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/12360/943/" frameborder="0" width="646" height="190"></iframe>

        After buying the game, go to the library, select the game and right click - Manage - CD keys and copy the key somewhere. You can refund it now.
    === "Trying out random GFWL keys online"
        This one is pretty self-explanatory - just go around online and look for random GFWL keys - they have multiple uses, so you might get lucky. These two Discord servers might help you:

        [:simple-discord: Grand Theft RevIVal](https://discord.gg/Wn5eCWGcpb){ .md-button .md-button--primary } [:simple-discord: Games For Windows Live Hub](https://discord.gg/d97u73k2TV){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
    === "RevIVal's community method"
        This Discord server is also one of the servers where you can find people to play multiplayer with. The channel with the activation method is `#gfwl-keys` (for promotion and respect reasons, I won't link it here directly), but check out the server itself too, we're welcome to anyone!

        [:simple-discord: Grand Theft RevIVal](https://discord.gg/Wn5eCWGcpb){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
    After you acquired the key and activated the game(again, this might take another 5-10 minutes, so get yourself a tea or something), you're ready to play!
???+ tip "Joining/Creating Lobbies"
    Either use the in-game phone's Multiplayer option to join or create a lobby, or add friends in the ++home++ overlay and join their lobbies instead.
