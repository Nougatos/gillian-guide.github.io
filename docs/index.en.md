# Introduction

Welcome to Gillian's GTA IV Guide.

This is a centralised, all-in-one guide. It includes steps for optimising, tweaking, fixing, improving the game and more!

## Prerequisites
!!! warning ""
    -In order for this guide to be useful to you, please make sure that the following requirements are met:
        * You *must* own the game on [:material-steam:Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/12210/) or the Rockstar Games Launcher. Pirated versions are not supported. Retail versions with 1.0.8.0 are not supported, but should work as long as you get rid of the DRM.
        * Your PC must at least meet the [minimum requirements of the game](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV#System_requirements). For a pleasant experience, however, it should meet [DXVK's requirements](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Driver-support) instead(ignore Linux requirements such as Wine if you're running Windows; older GPUs may the 1.10.3 requirements instead).
        * Make sure you have enough free space on your PC (the base game takes about 22GB, a backup will take just as much, plus count in all the modding you'd do - at least 4GB).
        * You need to have an archivator installed. I recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
        * Make sure you have the game's prerequisites installed(they're already taken care of by :material-steam:Steam and the Rockstar Games Launcher) - [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679) and [DirectX End-User Runtimes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109).

If you have no need for the in-depth tutorials, you can simply install the [drag-and-drop archive](Drag-and-Drop-Archive.md) and you are ready to go.
