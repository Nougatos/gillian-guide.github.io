# ZolikaPatch
!!! warning "Compatibility" 
    This mod is not compatible with the Complete Edition. ZolikaPatch can downgrade for you.

This mod aims to fix & improve various things in GTA IV, as well as greatly improve the [multiplayer](../multiplayer.md) experience. You can read the changelog [here](https://zolika1351.pages.dev/mods/ivpatch).

!!! warning "Notice"
    This section won't be updated until further notice due to ongoing drama between Fusion Team and Zolika, aswell as uncertainity of up-to-date information. My guide aims to be as unbiased as possible, trying to only provide relevant information to modding GTA IV only.

## Installation { data-search-exclude }
* Go to [Zolika1351's Zone](https://zolika1351.pages.dev/mods/ivpatch).
* Scroll to the bottom of the page and download the latest version.
* Extract :material-zip-box:`ZolikaPatch_vx_x.zip` into the game folder.
* If prompted to downgrade when opening the game, press Yes. It'll automatically downgrade everything.
???+ question "What's :material-file:`GFWLProtectionDisabler2019.asi`?"
    This mod is required to prevent [GFWL](../../multiplayer/#games-for-windows-live) from blocking `.asi` mods.

## Configuration
Open :material-file-cog:`ZolikaPatch.ini` and configure the file as needed. All the options already have descriptions.
