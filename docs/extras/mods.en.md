# Mods
The Grand Theft Auto series has a rich modding community that spans most GTA games, and GTA IV is no exception! This list contains all the vanilla-faithful mods I know of, but I won't list instructions on how to install them, as mods usually list their own instructions, so it becomes redundant.

    Be sure to back up your files before making any changes. Use a [modloader](modloading.md) to avoid file replacement - but this may not work for all mods.
