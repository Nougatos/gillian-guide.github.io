# Donations

Without the people listed in [credits](credits.md) we wouldn't have this guide, nor all these amazing tools and mods. So why not support them? I'm going to provide all available donation links for all people mentioned in the [credits](credits.md).

## ThirteenAG
Note: ThirteenAG is a resident of Russia, so he may not be able to accept the non-Boosty donations at the moment. They shouldn't just vanish if you so desire to send it, but he may not be able to receive it either. I have no 100% confirmation on this.
Note 2: Boosty is a Russian company.

## Me
I'd, of course, prefer if you sent donations to any other modders listed above rather than me - but I would be ultimately happy if you sent me a tip for all the time I spent making this website and everything else I'm associated with. I've been working on it for over 2 years, and I'm still going to update it actively as long as there's things to update. Also, keep in mind that hosting the website takes absolutely no money at the moment thanks to GitHub, aswell as the fact it doesn't make me any money as I don't have any ads. You can buy me a lot, actually. A dollar can buy me two little coffee cups :D. ==Note: I can't set up any other payment methods at the moment. This would send the tip directly to my debit.==
